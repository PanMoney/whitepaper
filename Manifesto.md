## Elevator Pitch

A merchant-first, mobile-centric universal trustless digital cash system in which every human being enjoys a roughly equal starting stake, targeted at the 5-billion-strong global extralegal economy, featuring a graduated, initial capital airdrop with a semi-automated verification and web of trust entrance process, an accompanying self-serve educational program and an aggressive, hands-on, localized and viral marketing strategy in the developing world, in order to stimulate a doubling of GDP across the developing world within 5 years of its launch, bring 2 billion new participants into the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem and solve the cryptocurrency adoption challenge.

## Executive Summary

Pan is a blockchain-based digital cash system that stakes every single member of humanity into its system. Pan works for everyone with access to a cellphone or web wallet, without buy-ins, bank accounts or credit cards.

We are committed to the Pan concept and are seeking your ideas, participation and investment because we believe that the 5-billion-member global informal economy, sometimes wholly or partly known as the global poor, with their existing but fragmented ledger systems and their exclusion from the globalizing financial world, represent not just the largest marketplace in the world but also the most fertile customer base for cryptocurrencies.

Without credit cards or bank accounts, the global poor, also known as the global undocumented, can not buy bitcoin at an exchange. They may not know anyone who deals in cryptocurrencies, and, because their assets are locked up as dead capital in fragmented legacy ledger systems, many are not liquid enough to invest in existing cryptocurrencies. Even when one individual is able to get bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency, it is likely that no one else in their existing economic network has any, and thus the cryptocurrency can serve only a highly limited, albeit useful, role as a store of value.

Pan proposes an initial coin distribution to every member of humanity in order to solve this problem. Through a multi-layered verification process, we will bootstrap a new opaque blockchain-based cryptocurrency and apportion a roughly equal number of coins to each member of humanity alive after the creation of the genesis block.

The goal of Pan is to incentivize 2 billion human beings to open Pan accounts within 5 years of launch in order to spark a Third World Miracle, like the one in East Asia in the latter half of the twentieth century. We aim to double the economic growth rate of the developing world within 10 years. We aim to effectively eradicate poverty within 25 years.

We are creating a new, globalized trustless digital cash and ledger system that is not compromised by rent-seeking middlemen like governments and banks. Within the Pan system, where participants can hold clear title to their property, we will have the basis of a competing globalizing world order with the individual human being at its center, protected from the predatory behavior of middlemen.

We believe that Pan represents a unique opportunity to grow cryptocurrency adoption worldwide. We can solve the problem of cryptocurrency distribution, provide an incentive to join the cryptocurrency world, and show the practical utility of cryptocurrencies in a developing world that presents a unique opportunity because it trusts its legacy institutions less every year and is straining to escape the boundaries of nation-state political borders and the predations of rent-seeking middlemen.

By going out and engaging with new prospective cryptocurrency users, the Pan project will learn what it takes to achieve global cryptocurrency adoption, information that will be of great value to current and future cryptocurrency projects.

The Pan project seek your feedback and participation.

### We Believe… 

### Ledgers are the Building Blocks 
- The ledger is the center and foundation of civilization and economy, because it tells us who is accountable for what.
- Most of the ledgers in use today in government and business are inefficient, expensive, opaque and by design susceptible to fraud and corruption. Today’s ledgers require trust in middlemen, such as governments and financial institutions, in order to operate properly. As such, there is a moral hazard inherent in today’s ledger systems.
- Twenty-first century nation-states have corrupted many of society’s ledgers, used the existing ledgers to engage in harmful rent-seeking to the benefit of the elite and the detriment of the mass population, and have excluded as much as 80% of humanity from the use of ledgers that are integrated into the global financial system, a situation that causes informality, poverty, lack of capital formation and exclusion from the globalizing world order, to the detriment of all humankind.
- All of humankind’s achievements come from connecting people and things, and capitalism enables us to find the best economic combinations of people and things, as economist Hernando de Soto has said.

We believe that the ledger is the foundation of economic progress but that today’s ledgers are corrupt and/or disconnected.

### It Starts with the Individual
- Every individual is the end goal of his own life, and has as his birthright the legal and moral right to live it in freedom, as he sees fit, without being subject to aggression or fraud.
- Every individual has the right to control his property.
- When every individual has the opportunity to realize his innate human potential, all humankind benefits. Each additional individual who has the opportunity to realize his potential in a way of his own choosing and is added to a network of similar individuals, adds value to that network in ways that are both seen and unseen.
- Every human being should have direct access to the global economy, to interact with it in his own way, consensually with other participants, without the intermediation of middlemen, and to shape his own societies as he deems appropriate, without using aggression or fraud, in consensual collaboration with others. He should not be forced to fit into anyone else’s paradigm but should be allowed to grow into his own paradigm.
- People shouldn’t have to emigrate to find a better life, they should be able to build it where they are with the tools they have now.
- Society starts with the individual. Governments, corporations and other rent-seeking middlemen come last. Successful economic systems originate with the individual through his consensual interactions with other individuals, and the government must accept them. Never the other way around.
- Our lives are determined by the stories we tell ourselves.
- Too many people tell themselves stories of scarcity. We can offer them stories of post-scarcity and abundance. We can build tools to validate stories of upward mobility.

We believe that the individual is the beginning and the end of all economic growth, and has liberty as his birthright.

### Poverty is Unacceptable
- “Poverty is the scarcity or the lack of a certain (variant) amount of material possessions or money,” as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty) states.
- 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 per day.
- 80% of humanity spends its life in a precarious and ultimately wasteful search for its next meal due to lack of capital, thereby losing uncountable potential contributions of talent and genius to the global culture.
- 3 billion people live on less than $2.50 per day. Almost half of them live in extreme poverty on less than $1.25 per day.
- 25% of humanity lives without electricity.
- 40% of humanity does not have basic sanitation.
- 1 billion people use unsafe drinking water sources.
- 800,000 people die every year due to diarrhea that results from inadequate drinking water, sanitation, and hand hygiene.
- 800 million people, 300 million of which are children, do not have enough food to eat.
- 90% of these 300 million children are enduring long-term malnourishment.
- “The poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty,” as The World Food Programme has argued.
- More people die every year from hunger than from  HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined.
- Every 3.6 seconds, a person dies of starvation, most of them children under 5.
- 1 billion children are in poverty across the globe and 22,000 of them die every day because of poverty, and, according to UNICEF, they “die quietly in some of the poorest villages on earth, far removed from the scrutiny and the conscience of the world. Being meek and weak in life makes these dying multitudes even more invisible in death.”
- 5 million people, mostly children, die each year from water-borne diseases.
- 150 million children under 5 have seen their growth stunted due to chronic malnutrition, accounting for approximately 27% of all children in the developing world, and mostly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
- 2 million children die every year of preventable diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia because they can not afford proper treatment.
- 72 million children of primary school age in the developing world are not going to school, 57 per cent of whom are girls.
- Population growth in Africa is such that the continent of Africa will hold 40% of humanity by 2100. Africa is the future and the number of human lives that will be created there in the next 80 years demand that good people work together to ensure they are healthy and prosperous lives that add to the greater future of humanity.
- 4 billion people are locked out of the global capitalist system.
- People understandably get violent when they feel they are excluded, though violence is only excusable when used in self-defense.
- Poverty leads to social unrest and social divides because of income inequality.
- Ills associated with poverty include substance abuse, debilitating accidents due to unsafe working conditions, hazards such as lead and pesticide poisoning, substandard living conditions, disease, child labor, child soldiers, substandard infrastructure, unemployment, domestic violence, shortened life expectancy, stunted growth, terrorism and more.
- The value of the wages of the global poor decline in real terms due to the inflation of fiat currency by nation-states but wealth perpetuates itself indefinitely, so the poor can not catch up just by working harder.
- The global poor can’t effectively save any excess income they produce because either no bank will serve them or banks charge fees that eat through their meager savings, and because inflation eats the value of their savings.
- Poverty affects women and children disproportionately.
- Poverty can become a self-sustaining cycle that becomes difficult to break.
- People are escaping poverty worldwide but their progress is precarious and too slow.

We believe that the global poverty situation is entirely unacceptable, that it presents a grave threat to the future economic, intellectual and cultural development of humanity — and that we can fix it within 25 years.

### The Global Poor are not so Poor
- The global poor are not so much poor as undocumented, not so much unemployed as undercapitalized, and not so much undercapitalized as their capital is illiquid (not fungible).
- The root of poverty is the lack of liquid capital with which to invest in economically productive ends, of which there are many accessible to the global poor.
- The global poor are more aptly named the global undocumented as they lack “the documents required to live, work and make contracts in a particular place,” as Hernando de Soto has said. This results in a state of defenseless against expropriation and environmental contamination by powerful entities, as well as great difficulty in accessing credit and capital.
-  The global poor are the backbone of the global extralegal economy, an economy that operates outside of nation-state-approved markets because its members are excluded from participation in the legal economy due to lack of government registration documents, due to a desire to avoid taxation and expropriation, and for other valid reasons.
- The global extralegal, or informal, economy is the largest, but most fragmented, marketplace in the world.
- More than half of total employment (much if not most of it self-employment) in developing countries is in the informal economy, and as much as 90 percent in South Asia and Africa.
- The informal economy is more than 1/3 of the developing world’s GDP. 27% of non-agricultural output in North Africa comes from the informal economy. That number is 29% in Latin America and 31 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
- 70% of the economies in Thailand and Nigeria are the informal economy.
- 65% of homes in the Philippines are unregistered, a number that is above 80% in many other developing countries.
- The poor in Peru own assets valued at more than 11 times the value of the equities on the Lima Stock Exchange.
- The global poor own the majority of the world’s assets but they lack the financial system to leverage it.
- The poor are able to create wealth. The problem is that it is fragmented among many different extralegal systems and ledgers. Blockchain technology can solve this problem and, in doing so, unleash the economic power of the extralegal economy.
- The global poor are more entrepreneurial than the global elite.
-  The global poor do not require a basic income, foreign aid or charity. They will most benefit from a capital airdrop to make liquid their existing human capital along with a universal, stateless distributed ledger system through which they can enjoy international identity, value transfer, value storage, asset registry, contract recording, credit, the issuance of shares in their enterprises, governance and more. This will connect the global undocumented in a global ledger and marketplace without speed bumps or corruption that is larger than the first-world globalizing economy.
- The global undocumented are going to find a way for their fragmented ledgers to interoperate. When they do, they will unleash an unstoppable wave of economic growth. Helping the global undocumented achieve the equity they require to experience rapid economic growth is going to be both fun and profitable for for every human being.
- The global migration from rural to urban areas is a migration in search of capitalism. These people are in transition, are prime candidates for cryptocurrency adoption and can be ambassadors for crypto in the urban milieu.
- The global poor are told they must globalize; that is to say join an economic system dominated by the global elite. But they need only blockchainize in order to realize the benefits of capitalism and outstrip the wealth created by the global elite over the last two centuries.

We believe that the global poor are lacking mostly in liquid capital, and that when their capital is made liquid, that it will catalyze a wave of economic growth across the developing world that will enrich all humanity and significantly reduce global poverty.

### Middlemen are Obsolete
- Rent-seeking middlemen, such as governments, banks, insurance companies, social networks, internet service providers, marketplace operators, lawyers, accountants and courts, are an unnecessary vestige of 20th-century state capitalism and, in fact, are the prime impediment to the continued economic growth of all humankind because they interfere with direct person-to-person economic relationships, reduce efficiency and increase costs without adding comparative value.
- Government bureaucracy is holding back the economic development of the global poor by making them jump through overly-demanding hoops in order to register their property and businesses, and improve them.
- Financial middlemen in the developing world maintain their power by denying credit, and thereby controlling who may enter any given market. Together with bureaucrats and their infamous red tape, these two groups are effective at keeping the global poor in poverty.
- Freed markets generate economic growth but closed and protected markets fail to grow.
- Many governments in the developing world have enacted barriers to free trade that stifle economic growth for their citizens.
- Governments, through their mismanagement of currency and property ledgers, have caused economic bubbles and excessive indebtedness across all levels of society.
- The global mass population has lost trust in their national institutions, such as government, corporations, media and non-profit organizations, in 20 of 28 countries surveyed in the 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer, and trust levels are declining in 21 of 28 countries.
- The idea of a trusted central authority is broken because society is simply too complex. Society must be polycentric.
- Middlemen must be cut from the economic landscape through the practice of individuals doing business directly with each other. We can and should end middlemen.
- The Age of the Organization is dead, as Taylor Pearson argues. We are now entering a Blockchain Era, where the savvy individual is able to coordinate the services not just of an organization but of the globe.
- The issuance of money is best based on a mathematical formula that is a factor of the growth of humanity, and not based on the arbitrary whims of governments, central banks or credit banks and that is not based on debt, and is not therefore a trap for the least liquid when credit contractions are effected.
- We need a monetary system that is built to serve the individual human being, rather than to make a profit off of his back. 

We believe it is time to start fresh with a new trustless distributed-ledger-based system that recognizes the individual human being as the center of the system and the source of all value, that includes everyone, roughly equally, and that gets rent-seeking middlemen out of the picture so individuals can trade directly across and within nation-state borders.

### Blockchains Work
- The blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, as pioneered by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is a viable upgrade for the world’s ledgers because it minimizes the need for trusted third-party middlemen, makes it easier to solve disputes, can reduce risk and fraud and hold all of a system’s participants to a very high degree of accountability.
-  The blockchain can be used not just as a digital cash system by every human being, but also as a trustworthy ledger to replace the untrustworthy ledgers of the nation-states and the fragmented ledgers of the extralegal economy.
- Today’s existing middlemen can not be trusted to implement the ledgers of tomorrow, whether they use distributed ledger technology or not. They have proven themselves untrustworthy. We must design a new trust-minimized distributed ledger ecosystem that routes around today’s middlemen as if they were damaged nodes in an economic network.
- The blockchain is immutable and therefore resistant to the self-serving tampering that has previously led to such debacles as the Lost Decade in Japan, the 2007-2008 financial crisis in the United States, ponzi schemes and other examples of middleman corruption.
- The blockchain is a tool that is apt for storing and preserving the truth of any given economic situation because it is tamper-evident and largely incorruptible, and is compatible with Mohandas K. Gandhi’s satyagraha, otherwise known as truth force, a viable nonviolent alternative to the use of violence in human affairs.
- Blockchainism is a political philosophy that stands in contrast to capitalism and socialism and is characterized by the use of decentralized trustless mechanisms for managing the economic relations of individuals, the ruthless elimination of middlemen, the enshrinement of the individual as the center of the economic universe, a disregard for the artificial and constricting borders of nation-states, and the favoring of nonviolent truth force over aggression in order to solve problems. Blockchainism is anti-tribal, pro-individual and anti-conformity. Blockchainism finds value in everything and seeks to make it liquid via tokenization — the process of creating a digital counterpart for all assets that can be controlled directly by the owner. Blockchainism chooses agency over obedience, markets over central planning and exit over voice.
- Using blockchains, we can formalize the fragmented ledgers of the 5-billion-person-strong extralegal economy and connect them in a new, corruption-resistant global economic system that is under individual control and is free of rent-seeking middlemen in order to foster equitable economic growth for all and reduce economic inequality using freed markets.

We believe that the blockchain is a viable tool to unify the fragmented ledgers of the extralegal into a new, global freed marketplace where all can enjoy prosperity.

### Some Blockchain-Based Systems are Better than Others
- The most successful cryptocurrency is the one that is understood, held and used by the greatest number of people, with the highest rate of merchant adoption, for the broadest number of uses with the highest velocity of money and the lowest transaction fees.
- The most adopted blockchain will be the one that is designed to meet the needs of the largest target market. A successful blockchain system is designed in consultation with its customers, not alone or only in consultation with other blockchain experts.
- The most widely adopted blockchain digital cash system leads with merchant adoption.
- The most successful blockchain digital cash system takes extra steps to protect its users from theft and loss of private keys.
- The best blockchain digital cash system enables participants to protect their capital from rent-seeking middlemen.
- The most successful blockchain digital cash system is preceded and accompanied by a self-serve educational program to instruct new cryptocurrency adopters on how blockchains work, security in a blockchain world, the basics of business, growth mindset and more, as well as multiple methods for participants to connect with each other directly and independently.
- Blockchain technology needs to scale. The cryptocurrency ecosystem will benefit from a project that is focused on bringing in large numbers of new participants because such a project will create strong demand and urgency for finding scaling solutions.
- The best way to scale blockchain technology is to build demand first. Make the people come, and the developers will build it.

We believe that the most successful blockchain will be the one with the most participants who use it the most.

### The Crypto Economy Must Grow
- The crypto world is too small. The number of cryptocurrency users is estimated by some sources at between 3 million and 10 million, and may not reach 200 million users before 2024. Even if we are 50 million, that is only 1% of all human beings between the ages of 15 and 64.
- The crypto world is too centralized, likely not due to any conspiracy but just due to the small size of our community. The top 4 Bitcoin mining groups control 53% of the average mining capacity. Three miners control 61% of Ethereum’s mining capacity.
- Adoption is far from solved, with unattractive wallet user interfaces, confusion among new users and other inconveniences.
- Buy-in is a financial and technical challenge for everyone but the global elite. The global poor have no credit cards or bank accounts, generally speaking. When they can get some cryptocurrency, they find that few or none of their real-world trading partners have crypto, and the most they can do with their cryptocurrency is hold it indefinitely.
- The global poor are the group who will have the most uses for cryptocurrency, given that their current ledgers are fragmented, their fiat currency savings are inflated away and their nation-states reduce their ability to realize economic growth.
- By distributing new cryptocurrencies based on existing wealth, we have locked the global poor — those who stand most to benefit and those who can be our best collaborators because they are outside the current government-banking system — out of cryptocurrencies.
- Cryptocurrency that does not serve the mass population of Earth is a technological toy, nothing more.

We believe that there is a great deal of urgency to bring new people into  the crypto world in order to improve decentralization, adoption and the general utility of cryptocurrency systems. 

### Generally Speaking
- Incentives are more powerful and useful than violence.
- Standing up to power is more effective than compromising with it.
- Simplicity is best.
- Economics is not a zero-sum game. Together, we can all grow.
- Honesty, integrity and transparency are building blocks of a prosperous world.
- Cryptocurrency tends to bring prosperity to its adopters over the medium to long term.
- The big picture is more important than the details and the details flow from the big picture.
- If we don’t bring the global poor into the crypto space, we will be the losers.
- A payment system that includes everyone benefits everyone.
- All humanity would benefit if every human being at the age of majority received a birthright capital airdrop.

We believe that good people must step forward and create new trustless money and ledger systems to realize a vision of humanity that includes everyone in a borderless, freed global marketplace.

## We Intend to…

Pan’s goal is to bring 2 billion individuals within the first 5 years of its launch into a trustless digital cash system whose design is based on market research in the developing world via a roughly equal starting stake for every participant, merchant adoption incentives, a business and crypto skills training program, localized viral marketing and a staged rollout; and by doing so double the GDP growth rate across the developing world within 10 years. Once the digital cash system is working, we may also add smart contract functionality in order to facilitate identity, asset registry and related features within the Pan system.

### Market Research 

We will talk to experts on the informal economy, economics, poverty, blockchain and more. We will also communicate extensively with members of our target market across the world in order to understand first-hand what they need and how we can best help them in building a trustless digital cash system that enables them to trade freely and store value securely, free from the interference of legacy middlemen.

### Initial Development

We will create a trustless digital cash system that issues a roughly equal absolute number of coins (maybe 1,000) to each human being alive after the creation of the genesis block. This issuance is called the initial coin distribution, or ICD.

We will create a multi-layered verification process whose purpose is to ensure that each human being claims only one ICD. The exact details of this verification process remain to be determined based on your feedback, but we anticipate that they might include:

- linkage with existing identification schemes, such as a national ID.
- biometrics, such as facial scans and others.
- a web of trust, whereby new entrants must be verified by existing participants, like a key-signing party.

We anticipate that the number of coins in the ICD will decline over time as a way to incentivize adoption.

### Business Skills & Mindset Education

Pan will design and implement a self-serve training program in the languages of our target market in order to prepare participants to adequately secure their private keys, use their initial coin distribution and effectively operate a business, among other things.

Part of this program will have to be completed prior to receiving the ICD. Other parts will be available afterwards. We may gamify this program.

### Marketing

Pan will design and implement a marketing system with intelligent incentives to catalyze the viral growth of Pan. We will start with merchant adoption.

We will also foster the development of a Pan ecosystem with different roles and custom training programs for such roles as ambassadors, evangelists, community organizers, teachers and more. We will encourage Pan participants to create their own channels for communication, outside the purview of the Pan organization, using tools such as Discord, Slack, Telegram, Steem and more.

We will develop a global network of Pan power users who can independently bring new expert Pan users into the ecosystem.

Neither affiliate marketing nor multi-level marketing will play a role in the Pan system.

### Initial Testing

Once we have a working system, we will trial Pan in one or more suitable markets. We are looking for large markets, with sizable informal economies, that suffer from stagnant economic growth and are unified by language and culture. Some markets we are considering include:

- Spanish-speaking Latin America, specifically Mexico, Colombia and/or Argentina.
- The Philippines, where 100 million have some working capacity with English.
- Northern India, with its 540 million Hindi speakers.
- Brazil’s 207 million Portuguese speakers.
- the Malay speakers of Malasyia, Brunei Indonesia & Singapore.
- Bangladesh.
- Vietnam

We will apply what we learn from the initial testing period to improve the Pan system for rollout to the rest of the world, which may happen in stages.

Ideally, we will reach a stage where the Pan organization loses a significant amount of control over the rollout process and it would become viral and polycentric.

We will learn how to effectively implement the adoption of cryptocurrencies across the globe and will share everything we learn in an open source fashion with the cryptocurrency community, so that all crypto projects can benefit.

### Smart Contracts

Pan aims to add smart contracts to the Pan ecosystem in the future, in order to provide identity, asset registration, share issuance, credit, crowdfunding and other tools essential to the operation of a market economy.

The Pan organization may launch the smart contracts solution or there may be a marketplace of competing interoperable solutions.

## Why We Need Pan
Pan has the potential to solve many challenges, both in the cryptocurrency space and in the greater world.

### The World Needs Pan
- Ameliorate global poverty through a capital airdrop and a system for the global exchange and safeguard of value, so that people everywhere can trade securely.
- Increase savings, capital formation and investment rates as individuals are able to safely secure the profits of their labor safe from the inflationary policies of nation-states’ fiat currencies.
- Reduce immigration from the third world to the first world by enabling people to solve problems of exclusion and capital formation, so they can grow and improve their societies where they are.
- Realize the potential of children who today do not have access to modern technology, education, nutrition and healthcare by releasing undocumented capital which can be used to invest in the basic services and infrastructure required for the realization of human potential, such as educational institutions, clinics, farms, roads, food distribution systems and much more.
- Enable young people to access existing self-serve education via app stores and mobile devices where basic internet service and in-app purchases are required.
- Overcome societal distrust, which can be a contributing factor to slow economic growth in the developing world.
- Solve the problem of failing nation-states, by making the nation-state largely obsolete.
- Make the extralegal economy its own unified marketplace in its own right, without it having to kowtow to the rule of rent-seeking middlemen.
- Catalyze rapid economic growth like that seen in Japan post-WWII or in the four East Asian economies of Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan in the latter half of the 20th century — but this time for 5 billion people, rather than just 100 million.
- Reduce the sex trade / sex trafficking and other forms of slavery, if not outright eliminate them, because poverty is one of the leading causes of slavery in the world today.
- Reduce population growth and therefore global warming risks, given that having many children is a strategy among some of the global poor for alleviating poverty.
- Improve access to education and healthcare, increase literacy and reduce infant mortality across the world.
- Move the developing world towards greater parity with the developed world.
- Facilitate the building blocks of the institutions required for the development of a full market economy in areas where the state is failing.

### The Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Needs Pan
- Bring 2 billion new users into the cryptocurrency world within 5 years. Even if we only brought 200 million, it would still be significant.
- Establish a template for successful cryptocurrency adoption that other crypto projects can follow.
- Demand for other cryptocurrencies could increase as hundreds of millions of people who hold Pan wish to diversify their crypto holdings.
- Our market research could provide useful information cryptocurrency projects that will dispose them to greater success.
- Those whom Pan trains in the use of cryptocurrencies can then become capable volunteers and evangelists for other crypto projects.
- Open up a whole new marketplace of people who are literally dying for cryptocurrency.
- Catalyze a strong demand for scaling solutions.
- Make blockchain technology and crypto influencers and investors responsible for creating a global system of justice and inclusion.
- Establish cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as the key technology for solving poverty, for reducing global inequality, for sparking prosperity in any cultural group, for reducing or eliminating preventable deaths, for feeding hundreds of millions of hungry children and for eliminating modern-day slavery.
- Realize the vision of a freed global marketplace without the need for legacy middlemen or aggression.
- If we don’t bring the global poor into the crypto space, we will be the losers.

Pan is a make-or-break project for the crypto space because Pan will be the first cryptocurrency held by as many as 2 billion people within the next 5 years. If Pan fails, it will be a setback for all cryptocurrencies. When Pan succeeds, it will pave the way for all other cryptocurrencies and platforms to include billions of new people in their ecosystems.

## Why a New Cryptocurrency is Required
The Pan vision can only be realized with a new blockchain for the following reasons:

- It is simply too expensive to stake billions of people into an existing cryptocurrency. Let’s say we wanted to give 1,000 satoshis (BTC) each to 5 billion people. That’s 5 trillion satoshis, or 50,000 BTC, which has a current market value of approximately USD$570 million at the time of writing. We can create a new system, in which we can optimize all the design decisions, for a lot less than USD$570 million.
- The poor don’t have the time or reliable internet connectivity to navigate a faucet and wait around to get a small fraction of a coin every 5 minutes or hour. Even for those who do have the resources necessary, the utility of their faucet-sourced coins depends on other members of their real-life economic network engaging in the same activity, something that is unlikely to happen. Even if we could get 5 billion people to use faucets, that is not a wise use of their time nor would it result in a favorable impression for cryptocurrencies.
- The global poor do not have adequate opportunity to earn cryptocurrencies, as in most cases their current livelihoods already do not afford them enough income, so they can not dedicate the time required to joining earn.com, to take one example — that is if they even have the reliable internet connection and level of expertise that is monetizable online. Even those who do earn cryptocurrency online experience the same challenge as faucet users, which is that they lack real-world trading partners who also accept cryptocurrencies.
- The set of design choices arising from our market research will likely differ from the set of design choices of existing cryptocurrencies.
- Even tho some of our core beliefs are based on the work of economist Hernando de Soto, we do not believe that de Soto’s announced blockchain land registry venture with Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne will be adequate to achieve the vision we’ve put forth, as the DeSoto Inc. vision is essentially a conservative one of the global poor fitting into the globalizing nation-state system whereas we reject the idea that the nation-state is a suitable entity for preserving the truth of property ownership records.

### What Makes Pan Different
We believe the following characteristics make the Pan project unique in the cryptocurrency space.

- Pan’s target market is the 5-billion-member global extralegal economy.
- Pan promises roughly equal initial staking for every human forever. Pan is for everyone, everywhere. It’s a new human birthright.
- Pan includes an incentive for the entire world to use Pan cryptocurrency from day 1. Because every person has a roughly equal amount.
- Pan includes a training program to bring new users up to speed, in their own language, on topics such as cryptocurrency security, business skills and more.
- Pan will have incentives for merchant adoption and will actively woo merchants before releasing the initial coin distributions. Pan will be useful from day 1.
- Pan is big-picture thinking that aims to conclusively make the case for cryptocurrency by sparking a global economic “miracle” like the one in East Asia in the latter half of the twentieth century.
- Pan is putting people first and technology second. We will build the technology to suit the people.
- Pan includes a massively parallel viral growth program focused on adoption across developing world cultures.
- Pan doesn’t seek government acceptance but to build an alternative to nation-state corruption.
- A very large portion of the Pan coin supply is reserved for participants, ideally 95% or more.
- Pan aims to solve the adoption problem for the cryptocurrency space.

### Pan vs. Other Anti-Poverty Projects

#### Basic Income

The Universal Basic Income (UBI) is the idea that governments will provide a subsistence-level, lifetime income stream to every human being. This is expensive, dependency-forming, subsistence-focused and unlikely to ever happen.

UBI research in the developing world suggests that cash infusions prompt people to improve their lives. But what if what they are really testing is the effectiveness of capital infusions? And/or of just making participants’ existing human capital partially liquid?

Pan is like a Universal Basic Capital Grant (UBCG). It is a one-time capital airdrop that enables participants to build their own income streams as they sees fit. This is capitalistic and anarchistic.

#### Microcredit

Microcredit is the extension of loans to individuals who usually are unable to qualify for credit from the formal financial sector. Microcredit is used widely around the globe but it has not succeeded for everyone and has trapped some in even deeper poverty.

While it is a promising approach, it piggybacks off of the existing nation-state financial system, and thus we believe its potential is limited and its effect on poverty is slower than can be achieved by simply instantiating a new, freed economy that starts with an airdrop of capital in the form of Pan’s initial coin distribution.

#### Charity and Foreign Aid

Charity and foreign aid have been effective for certain purposes but the size of it is ultimately dwarfed by the amount of capital the global poor have locked up in fragmented ledger systems, and it does nothing to change this situation. Pan, however, can radically improve this situation such that the role of charity and foreign aid could dwindle to almost nothing within 25 years.

## Call to Action

Wealth perpetuates itself but the global poor are left behind, struggling to survive with less, excluded from the opportunities to advance that every human being so desperately seeks. Better food, cleaner water, sanitation, security, education, a chance at something better — we all want these things and the global poor are no different.

Global poverty has been a problem for too long. Today we worry about the next gadget to come out, the increase in computing power of the newest iPhone, how powerful machine learning is becoming… but we forget that the most powerful computer is the human mind. How many Satoshi Nakamotos, Albert Einsteins or Srinivasa Ramanujans have been lost to poverty and its countless side effects?

- How many have died alone in forgotten hovels, their bellies aching for something to eat?
- How many children have seen their intellectual, musical and other talents lost because they were forced to work, become a child soldier or entered the sex trade? How can we calculate the cost to humanity of this loss of intelligence, cultural richness and progress?
- How many have been lost to preventable diseases?
- How many are dying right now, valuable individuals who could have made a contribution to the cultural richness of all humanity?
- How many more will needlessly suffer and die, struggling to enjoy the benefits of first-world ledger systems that we take for granted, begging for any chance at inclusion in the global system before we act?

We will no longer accept that some live in poverty while others live in comfort, when a clear solution is so readily available. We will no longer trust governments, corporations or non-profit organizations to solve global poverty. We will go straight to those experiencing poverty, we will talk to them and we will work with them to create the tools so they themselves can overcome it in the ways that work for them.

We must take action now to help our fellow men and women among the global poor to have access to a cryptocurrency economy in which they each have a roughly equal stake, through which they can unify their fragmented ledgers and spark economic growth that will pull themselves out of poverty.

Join the Pan project today. Offer feedback. Volunteer. Share the manifesto. Together, we are going to spark an economic revolution across the globe that works for everyone. 

## Guiding Questions
Here are some questions that have guided the creation of this document.

- We know what projects to make rich people richer look like. What about a project to make poor people a little bit wealthier? What does that look like?
- What if immigration from the third world to the first world is just an attempt to gain access to capital and a ledger system that is relatively less corrupted and fragmented?
- What if basic income experiments in the developing world are not testing the effectiveness of a basic income but the utility of receiving an infusion of liquid capital?
- How can we 100x the adoption of cryptocurrencies in 10 years? 
- How can we bring a billion new people into cryptocurrencies in the next 5 years?

## The Pan Organization

### Principles
We hold the following principles as foundational to the Pan project.

- **Equity**: Rough equality of beginning in the Pan system for every human being.
- **Accountability**: We answer to our stakeholders for our actions. No exceptions.
- **Transparency**: Absolutely no secrets.
- **Integrity**: We do what we said we would do. Our word is our bond.
- **Loyalty**: We hold fast to the beliefs expressed in this document and what is best for our target market.
- **Independence**: No unnecessary kowtowing to legacy middlemen.
- **Cooperation**: We seek to work cooperatively with everyone interested in this vision.

### Vision

We envision a world where the global informal economy, with its 5 billion participants, becomes the global blockchain economy and lets loose a torrent of economic growth that will solve persistent problems like poverty, malnutrition, early death, sex trafficking and more.

We envision a world in which individuals are in control of the product of their labor and can securely save and invest it to improve their lives, as they see fit, in a freed global marketplace without interference from rent-seeking middlemen such as governments and government-protected corporations.

We envision a world in which every human being has an immediate financial stake in the system, and can immediately have in a liquid format their human capability and economic potential.

We envision a world in which every human being that reaches the age of majority, forever, begins their life with a birthright capital airdrop in the form of Pan coins. No longer must some humans scrape by in poverty forever because their parents were also poor. No longer must some humans predicate their education on the belief that they must find employment at the age of majority. They can guide their educational program towards the exploration of their passions, the realization of their innate talents, and upon the age of majority have the capital required to start a business, pursue advanced education or do whatever they like. Every child is now born with a trust fund. 

We envision a world with 2 billion new cryptocurrency users within 5 years of the launch of Pan, where these users actively use a wide range of cryptocurrencies, where cryptocurrency adoption is no longer a subject for concern but a reality, where we are experiencing a doubling of developing world GDP within 10 years of the launch of Pan, and have effectively eradicated poverty within 25 years.

We envision a world of fairness, transparency and property, where middlemen no longer block anyone’s path to the global economy, where all are included, by default, where the humanity can flourish and reach for new highs in science, philosophy, economics, industry, music, health, education and much more.

We envision a world with Pan cryptocurrency for all.

### Technology
To be determined. We’re seeking a technical lead to give shape to this area of the project.

That said, it is likely that Pan will not require heavy development of new technology and we will be able to leverage existing blockchain technology to achieve the project’s goals.

### Roadmap
To be determined. We’re seeking core team members to give shape to this area of the project.

Feedback stage: Jan 29 to Apr 30, 2018
Estimated global launch: Jan 1, 2021

### Budget
To be determined. We’re seeking a financial lead to give shape to this area of the project.

We’re estimating 20 BTC to reach the stage where we can gain investment.

### Legal Structure
To be determined. We’re seeking guidance in order to give shape to this area of the project.

## Risks of the Pan Project
- We are unable to secure funding to create Pan.
	- We believe we have a great idea here and we’re going to work hard to make it happen.
- The price collapses by releasing too much Pan too fast.
	- We build price support by ensuring liquidity and merchant acceptance from day 1.
- There is a failure by the target market to understand or adopt Pan.
	- We will develop a comprehensive, self-serve and partially-mandatory (as a precondition of receiving the initial coin distribution) training system and marketing plan that will ensure the value of Pan is recognized and how to use it is thoroughly understood.
- Pan users immediately sell off their Pan once claimed.
	- We expect our educational program, combined with the decision to lead with merchant adoption, to remedy most of this. We also have the option of staging the initial coin distribution so that new participants don’t receive their entire initial coin distribution at once. 
- The verification system fails and sock puppet accounts abound.
	- We are confident that by connecting the Pan system with both current identification systems and biometrics, and by using a web of trust process, that we can reduce sock puppet accounts to an insignificant number. We will roll Pan out in stages and expect to improve the verification system as we learn from our first few rollouts.
- Blockchain technology fails to scale.
	- We are confident that solutions will be found to the scaling challenge. That said, we can temporarily throttle back the expansion of Pan to geographic areas outside of our trial markets if the need arises.
- Government action.
	- Governments are going to want to charge sales taxes, VAT and/or income taxes on Pan transactions. We’re confident that the people of the developing world will be able to make their own decisions as to how to handle any government action of this kind that arises. We plan to help them by implementing privacy features in Pan. We also expect to learn from the experience of Uber in entering new markets where the government posture is not friendly.
- Criminals preying on early users.
	- Early users of Pan may face action from criminal elements attempting to take their Pan. Privacy features are key to obscuring any given user’s Pan balance or entry into the system. We will also train participants on personal security and how they can cooperate with other Pan participants to improve their collective security.

## Conclusion

We live in a world of technological marvel and economic growth, where our basic human needs are taken care of so that we can realize our inherent and individual intellectual, artistic and social potential as human beings. But that vision is reality for only twenty percent of humanity.

Eighty percent of the human population lives on less than $10 per day. About half of the global poor live on $2.50 per day and a little less than half of them live in extreme poverty, on just $1.25 per day. These people are starved for capital, their lives spent in a constant, precarious and primitive search for their next meal. As a result, the global poor do not receive adequate education, nutrition, clean water or healthcare. As many as 22,000 children die every day because of poverty.

The global poor represent both a threat to the vision of global economic growth — because it’s not working for them — and its greatest potential engine. Humanity can not continue with only some of its number having access to prosperity. Either we must all have access to the promise of prosperity, or prosperity itself with stumble, falter and transmute into something else.

Wealth perpetuates itself through interest and return on investment, growing ever greater over time. But the poor trade their bodies and time for inflationary government-created fiat currency that declines in value over time. Any surplus wealth they create can not be saved in fiat currency because governments are constantly inflating it away, some more than others.

Thus we see, for example, the phenomenon of unfinished, un-lived-in houses in Kenya, where the best savings plan available is to buy concrete and build a new house. Or to have more and more children, a human savings plan that is smart for the individual parent but long-term only perpetuates the cycle of poverty and reduces quality of life for the many.

Basic income experiments have shown that when given extra capital that the global poor will use it to improve their lives, through investment and spending on necessities such as food and education.

We believe that every human being can realize their innate potential. We believe that every human being can be not just a self-sustaining economic unit, but also one that adds value to every other human economic unit on the planet through the institution of the free market, without a central authority to manipulate it.

We believe that what is lacking to realize this vision is capital, and not the expensive and dependency-forming government welfare that is the universal basic income.

We believe that the current world is one where governments too frequently pick winners and losers, where government, a rent-seeking middleman itself, effectively cultivates other rent-seeking middlemen to prey on the poor and prosper to the disadvantage of the poor, especially in the areas of government, banking, insurance, dispute resolution, property registration and currency.

We will create a blockchain-based global ledger system to replace the corrupted government-middleman order and the fragmented informal economy.

We will stake every human being over the age of majority into this system with an initial coin distribution. Every human being will have an incentive to become a part of the network and to start transacting in it. Every human being immediately is included in this system and has a stake in it. Existence is your buy-in. Prior to the receipt of the airdrop, they will have to complete a self-serve, video-based, mobile-first educational program in order to ensure they are prepared to use their new capital safely.

Humans will be able to exchange coins instantaneously and for low or no fees using only a cellphone. There will be incentives for merchant adoption. 

We have the vision. We will expand our vision by working with experts on poverty, economics, cryptocurrency, politics, economic development and more.

We will get funding in a method to be determined and onboard tech, marketing and support teams. We will take the best tech currently available in the cryptocurrency space and marry it to a savvy marketing program in order to gain massive adoption: 2 billion verified humans within 5 years.

We will perform initial testing of a proof of concept in the Latin American Spanish-speaking developing world, likely Mexico or Colombia, simultaneously with the Philippines (in English). With proper funding, we can add a third testing region, the 540 million Hindi speakers of Northern India.

Once we are near to having a working initial system, we will recruit and incentivize a network of community organizers using digital marketing who will catalyze the use of the currency in their local communities, simultaneously across the globe in a massively parallel process with the help of translators and community leaders. The process will ideally decentralize and take shape under the direction of the community leaders with the founding team just providing support.

We will add a smart contract layer to the blockchain with the intention of enabling humans to register assets so as to make them liquid (for mortgages) and tradeable. Our goal is to enable the poor to cut out rent-seeking middlemen from their lives, so they can have services like banking, insurance, dispute resolution, contract validation, social networking, currency exchange, governance, financial instruments, wills, medical records,  and more without having to rely on rent-seeking middlemen.

We will spark a global economic miracle like that of post-WWII Japan, Taiwan, South Korea or Singapore. We will become the tip of the adoption spear for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, bringing it to the largest marketplace ever: the global extralegal economy.

We are starting a conversation around this topic with the intention of seeking investment to make the project happen.

Much work remains to be done to clarify and implement the Pan vision. If you like our principles, plan and/or vision, then join us. Together, we will create a borderless, trustless global digital cash system for all humanity. Together, we will solve poverty and bring equitable power to those who are today excluded from the global financial system.

## Relevant Quotes

“Blockchain solves the problem of manipulation. When I speak about it in the West, people say they trust Google, Facebook, or their banks. But the rest of the world doesn’t trust organizations and corporations that much — I mean Africa, India, the Eastern Europe, or Russia. It’s not about the places where people are really rich. Blockchain’s opportunities are the highest in the countries that haven’t reached that level yet.” — Vitalik Buterin

“5 billion of the world’s 7 billion people don´t have the documents to live in a particular place.” “That’s 5 billion without any enforceable guarantee that they will not be expropriated or environmentally contaminated by powerful business, government, terrorists or criminals. That also means they will struggle to have access to credit or the ability to raise capital since borrowers typically need to pledge some kind of property in exchange” — Hernando de Soto

“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” ― Buckminster Fuller

“Blockchains can be thought of as an automatically notarised ledger. They alleviate the need for a trust service provider and are predicted to result in less capital being tied up in disputes. Blockchains have the potential to reduce systemic risk and financial fraud. They automate processes that were previously time-consuming and done manually, such as the incorporation of businesses.” — Wikipedia

“Only the tiny minority has capital that is integrated, networked, fungible, and protected by formal property systems. They are linked with the more developed world and can do business with people they don’t know. They also are the few who can afford expert lawyers, insider connections, and the patience to navigate the red tape of their property and legal systems. The vast majority of people are kept out. “ — Hernando de Soto

“As we approach a world without transaction costs, the equilibrium size of the corporation trends towards one person. That person is The Blockchain Man.” — Taylor Pearson

“Four billion of the world’s six billion, many of them with assets – homes and businesses – and eager to improve their life chances in the larger markets are outside the rule of law. Those four billion have little chance of success because discriminatory burdensome, and costly legal systems have kept them from the legal tools they need to cooperate economically on a national basis, never mind a global one. “ - Hernando de Soto

“Anecdotal evidence and nearly all empirical research has shown that unconditional cash transfers help people help themselves. … Other research has found that people's spending on alcohol and cigarettes actually went down when they received direct cash transfers. Faced with a brighter future, many people stop using temptation goods as a way to cope with a hopeless situation, researchers have discovered. In the village GiveDirectly is working with, interviews with nearly a dozen recipients showed that most people have actually worked more since the study began.” — Chris Weller, writing for [BusinessInsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/kenya-village-disproving-biggest-myth-about-basic-income-2017-12)

“Without an integrated formal property system, a modern market economy is inconceivable. Had the advanced nations of the West not integrated all representations into one standardized property system and made it accessible to all, they could not have specialized and divided labor to create the expanded market network and capital that have produced their present wealth. The inefficiencies of non-Western markets have a lot to do with the fragmentation of their property arrangements and the unavailability of standard representations.” — Hernando de Soto

“The law must be spoken from the thoughts of the people.” — Eugen Huber

“Formal property’s contribution to mankind is not the protection of ownership; squatters, housing organizations, mafias, and even primitive tribes manage to protect their assets quite efficiently. Property’s real breakthrough is that it radically improved the flow of communications about assets and their potential.” — Hernando de Soto

“Because the free market system is so weak politically, the forms of capitalism that are experienced in many countries are very far from the ideal. They are a corrupted version, in which powerful interests prevent competition from playing its natural, healthy role.” — Raghuram G. Rajan

“The poor aren’t breaking the laws, the laws are breaking them.” — Hernando de Soto

“Whereas the main social scalability benefit of the Internet has been matchmaking, the predominant direct social scalability benefit of blockchains is trust minimization. A blockchain can reduce vulnerability by locking in the integrity of some important performances (such as the creation and payment of money) and some important information flows, and in the future may reduce the vulnerability of the integrity of some important matchmaking functions.  Trust in the secret and arbitrarily mutable activities of a private computation can be replaced by verifiable confidence in the behavior of a generally immutable public computation.” — Nick Szabo

“Capital, like energy, is a dormant value. Bringing it to life requires us to go beyond looking at our assets as they are to actively thinking about them as they could be. It requires a process for fixing an asset’s economic potential into a form that can be used to initiate additional production.” — Hernando de Soto

“On the poverty front, there is overwhelming evidence that trade openness is a more trustworthy friend of the poor than protectionism. Few countries have grown rapidly without a simultaneous rapid expansion of trade. In turn, rapid growth has almost always led to reduction in poverty.” — Arvind Panagariya

“You’ve never touched capital. You’ve never seen capital. It’s the additional value things have that you can capture on paper. And just as you cannot create energy with your bare hands, you cannot create capital with your bare brains. You need machinery behind it to capture it. That’s what property rights do. They capture on paper the additional value of your production.” — Hernando de Soto

“Wealth is all about combining resources, to make pencils, to make clocks, to make machinery. And the way you bring things together is by knowing precisely who owns what. To be able to use possessions to guarantee credit. By being able to issue shares over assets so that people will finance or invest. By having contracts that people will trust. That is what the Europeans got over the last 100 – 150 years ago and managed to go from poverty to wealth.” — Hernando de Soto

“The private sectors of most developing world countries are not really capitalists. They exist largely on the basis of competing for government favors, contracts, and privileges, and their economic approach is to try to exclude or marginalize competitors — not by outproducing them in quantity, quality, or prices, but through political means, from legislation to outright use of the many resources of legal coercion at the disposal of a modern state. It is these people who are giving capitalism a bad name. This is why I have characterized these official economies not as a free-market economy but as mercantilist economies.” — Hernando de Soto

“In every country we have examined, the entrepreneurial ingenuity of the poor has created wealth on a vast scale—wealth that also constitutes by far the largest source of potential capital for development. These assets not only far exceed the holdings of the government, the local stock exchanges, and foreign direct investment; they are many times greater than all the aid from advanced nations and all the loans extended by the World Bank.” — Hernando de Soto

“For example, imagine a building whose value on the market, the legal market, is about $70 million. If I were to tell somebody I was going to sell it to them, and we were about to sign a contract, and they said, ‘Mr. De Soto, could you please give me the title, the document?’, and I said, ‘I don’t have that title, but all the neighbors know it’s mine,’ this building would no longer be worth, in the market, $70 million. It would probably go down to something like five million dollars, ten million dollars, because those uncertainties are tremendous.” — Hernando de Soto

“Property seeds the system by making people accountable and assets fungible, by tracking transactions, and so forth…The connection between capital and modern money runs through property.” — Hernando de Soto

“The history of capitalism in the West is a story of how governments adapted the "people's law" into uniform rules and codes that all could understand and respect. Ownership once represented by dogs, fences, and armed guards is now represented by records, titles and shares. The moment Westerners were able to focus on the title of a house and not just the house itself, they achieved a huge advantage over the rest of humanity. With titles, shares and property laws, people could suddenly go beyond looking at their assets as they are (houses used for shelter) to thinking about what they could be (security for credit to start or expand a business). Through widespread, integrated property systems, Western nations inadvertently created a staircase that allowed their citizens to climb out of the grubby basement of the material world into the realm where capital is created.” — Hernando de Soto
